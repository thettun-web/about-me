Hi there, I'm Thet Naing Tun! 👋

Technology Leader in Training | Cybersecurity Specialist | Full-Stack Developer in Training

I am a driven technology professional currently based in Berlin, Germany, pursuing a Master in Technology and Management at CODE University of Applied Sciences.

With over 10 years of deep expertise in IT infrastructure and cybersecurity in Singapore, I am now bridging the gap between secure enterprise operations and modern software development. My approach is defined by servant leadership, resilience, and remaining calm in chaos.

## 🚀 About Me

I specialize in building and securing digital ecosystems. My career began in hands-on IT operations and evolved into strategic infrastructure management. I have a proven track record of managing complex Microsoft environments (O365, Entra ID, Intune) and enforcing strict security compliance (NIST CSF).

Currently, I am expanding my horizons into Software Engineering and Generative AI, applying my infrastructure background to build robust, secure, and scalable applications.

🔭 I’m currently working on: An Automated Research Engine that leverages AI to streamline data synthesis.

🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced Software Technologies, Strategic Management, and Entrepreneurship.

💬 Ask me about: Cybersecurity, Microsoft 365 Administration, Incident Response, and Servant Leadership.

⚡ Fun fact: I thrive in high-pressure environments and believe that kindness is a crucial leadership skill.
